A second-order spring damping system is implemented through admittance control, which is applied to the flexible control of the robotic arm in response to external force disturbances during trajectory tracking.  
At the same time, using particle swarm optimization algorithm, adaptive parameter adjustment of admittance control coefficient is achieved, making admittance control easier to use and reducing debugging difficulty.  
This repository is based on the data model of the Naiwei robot ECR5, and has provided two code implementation methods based on Matlab and Python. Computer simulation has been completed, but functional implementation has not yet been tested.
